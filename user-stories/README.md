User Stories Documentation
This directory contains user stories for the Airbnb Clone backend, a rental marketplace application. The user stories, derived from the use case diagram, describe key interactions between actors (Guest, Host, Admin) and the system, covering functionalities such as user registration, property booking, payment processing, and more.
Contents

user-stories.md: A Markdown file listing user stories that capture core system interactions, including:
User registration with email and password.
Booking a property for specific dates.
Making payments to secure reservations.
Adding property listings as a host.
Leaving reviews for booked properties.
Managing bookings as an admin.



Usage
To view the user stories, open user-stories.md in a Markdown viewer, such as GitHubâ€™s preview, or a text editor like Visual Studio Code. The stories are formatted with acceptance criteria for clarity.
Project Context
This documentation is part of the Airbnb Clone project, designed to meet ALX project requirements. The user stories complement the use case diagram in the use-case-diagram/ directory, the backend requirements in the features-and-functionalities/ directory, and the database schema (schema.sql) and sample data (seed.sql) in the alx-airbnb-database repository.
